Bitwise_operations:
A program that reads the values ​​of 2 non-negative integers x and y and prints the result of the following bitwise operations 
on the standard output:

bitwise NOT negation of each of them
bitwise AND conjunction between them
bitwise disjunction OR between them
bitwise exclusive disjunction XOR between them

Bitwise_operations_2:
Program that reads the values ​​of 1 non-negative integer z and non-negative integer n and prints the result of the following bitwise operations on standard output:
bitwise left shift n positions
bitwise shift right n positions

Special_bits:
А program that reads the value of a non-negative integer n and outputs to standard output the least significant bit and most significant bit in the binary representation of the number n.

Interval:
A program that reads the values ​​of two integers a and b that will represent the closed interval [a, b]. For invalid values, print an error message to standard output. Then enter a number x. Depending on the value of x, print to standard output:

Dot_in_circle:
A program that reads the coordinates of a point, the coordinates of the center of a circle, and the length of its radius and determines whether the point is inside the circle, on the circle itself, or outside the circle.On the first line of the standard input, read the three numbers describing the circle x0, y0, r, and on the second line, read two numbers x and y, which are the coordinates of the point. The corresponding program outputs should be Inside the Circle!, On the Circle!, Outside the Circle!.

Equationd:
Create a program that finds solutions to the following equations given the coefficients, considering all possible cases:

ax + b = 0
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
(ax + b)(cx + d) = 0

rectangle:
A program that reads the coordinates of 2 rectangles whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. A rectangle is described by four real-valued values ​​- the coordinates of its upper left and lower right corners. The program checks that the rectangles have at least one point in common and prints the result to standard output.

Point_in_coordinate_system:
A program that reads the coordinates of 2 rectangles whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes of the Cartesian coordinate system. The rectangle is described by four real-valued values ​​- the coordinates of its upper left and lower right corners. The program checks that the rectangles have at least one point in common and prints the result to standard output.

Point_in_triangle:
A program that reads the coordinates of a point from the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, as well as the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle. Output to standard output whether the point belongs to the triangle or does not belong to the triangle.
