bit_in_number:
Program that reads non-negative integers n and s from standard input and outputs the sth bit of number n to standard output.

changing_of_bits:
Program that reads nonnegative integers n, r, and s from standard input, changes the r-th bit of the number n to 1, changes the s-th bit of the number n to 0, and outputs the changed number n to standard output.

even_number:
Program that reads from standard input a non-negative integer and checks whether it is even using bitwise operations.
