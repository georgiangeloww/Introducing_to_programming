bit_in_number:
Program that reads non-negative integers n and s from standard input and outputs the sth bit of number n to standard output.

changing_of_bits:
Program that reads nonnegative integers n, r, and s from standard input, changes the r-th bit of the number n to 1, changes the s-th bit of the number n to 0, and outputs the changed number n to standard output.

even_number:
Program that reads from standard input a non-negative integer and checks whether it is even using bitwise operations.

bit_clear:
Program that reads non-negative integers n and r from standard input and sets the rth bit to 0, printing n on standard output.

bit_set:
Program that reads non-negative integers n and r from standard output and sets the rth bit to 1, printing n on standard output.

Bit_flip:

Change_variables
Program that reads from standard input two non-negative integers x and y and exchanges their values ​​using the bitwise XOR operation.

Power_of_two:
Program that reads from standard input the entire non-negative number n and checks whether the number n is a power of 2.

Power_of_four:
Program that reads from standard input a positive number n and checks whether the number n is a power of 4.

Count_of_bit1:
Program that reads a character from standard input and outputs to standard output how many bits in the character's decimal notation have the value 1.

Count_of_bit0:
Program that reads a character from standard input and outputs to standard output how many bits in the character's decimal notation have the value 0.

Hemming_distance:
Program that reads two characters from standard input and outputs to standard output the Hamming distance between the two decimal entries of the two characters. The Hamming distance shows in how many positions of the decimal entries there are bits of different value.
